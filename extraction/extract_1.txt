Step 1 downloads data as HTML and images and our code is omitted to satisfy copyright.

`extract_1_recipe_ids.json` contains the full list of recipe IDs we used in our paper (including ones which will be removed in later steps due to missing images or unmatched metadata).

The corresponding HTML pages that you need to fetch (e.g. with wget) are in https://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/drucken/{recipe_id}. You also need all the image files on those webpages (keep those file names the same).


For fddb, a recursive wget command can be used starting at https://fddb.info/db/de/produktgruppen/produkt_verzeichnis/index.html.
