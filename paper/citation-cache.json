We propose a machine-learning-based approach to predict the amount of calories from food images. Our system does not require any input from the user, except from an image of the food item. We take a pragmatic approach to accurately predict the amount of calories in a food item and solve the problem in three phases. First, we identify the type of the food item in the image. Second, we estimate the size of the food item in grams. Finally, by taking into consideration the output of the first two phases, we predict the amount of calories in the photographed food item. All these three phases are based purely on supervised machine-learning. We show that this pipelined approach is very effective in predicting the amount of calories in a food item as compared to baseline approaches which directly predicts the amount of calories from the image.},\n\turldate = {2019-08-02},\n\tbooktitle = {Proceedings of the {Thirty}-{First} {AAAI} {Conference} on {Artificial} {Intelligence}},\n\tpublisher = {AAAI Press},\n\tauthor = {Chokr, Manal and Elbassuoni, Shady},\n\tyear = {2017},\n\tpages = {4664--4669}\n}",

However, some of them need human help for calorie estimation, and even if it is automatic, food categories are often limited or images from multiple viewpoints are required. Then, it is not yet achieved to estimate food calorie with practical accuracy and estimating food calories from a food photo is an unsolved problem. Therefore, in this paper, we propose estimating food calorie from a food photo by simultaneous learning of food calories, categories, ingredients and cooking directions using deep learning. Since there exists a strong correlation between food calories and food categories, ingredients and cooking directions information in general, we expect that simultaneous training of them brings performance boosting compared to independent single training. To this end, we use a multi-task CNN [1]. In addition, in this research, we construct two kinds of datasets that is a dataset of calorie-annotated recipe collected from Japanese recipe sites on the Web and a dataset collected from an American recipe site. In this experiment, we trained multi-task and single-task CNNs. As a result, the multi-task CNN achieved the better performance on both food category estimation and food calorie estimation than single-task CNNs. For the Japanese recipe dataset, by introducing a multi-task CNN, 0.039 were improved on the correlation coefficient, while for the American recipe dataset, 0.090 were raised compared to the result by the single-task CNN.},\n\turldate = {2019-08-02},\n\tbooktitle = {Proceedings of the on {Thematic} {Workshops} of {ACM} {Multimedia} 2017},\n\tpublisher = {ACM},\n\tauthor = {Ege, Takumi and Yanai, Keiji},\n\tyear = {2017},\n\tkeywords = {calorie estimation, food recognition, multi-task cnn},\n\tpages = {367--375}\n}",

At run time, we apply the classifier (running on your phone) to predict which foods are present in your meal, and we lookup the corresponding nutritional facts. We apply this method to a new dataset of images from 23 different restaurants, using a CNN-based classifier, significantly outperforming previous work. The more challenging setting works outside of restaurants. In this case, we need to estimate the size of the foods, as well as their labels. This requires solving segmentation and depth / volume estimation from a single image. We present CNN-based approaches to these problems, with promising preliminary results.},\n\turldate = {2019-08-10},\n\tbooktitle = {2015 {IEEE} {International} {Conference} on {Computer} {Vision} ({ICCV})},\n\tauthor = {Myers, A. and Johnston, N. and Rathod, V. and Korattikara, A. and Gorban, A. and Silberman, N. and Guadarrama, S. and Papandreou, G. and Huang, J. and Murphy, K.},\n\tmonth = dec,\n\tyear = {2015},\n\tkeywords = {computer vision, image classification, image segmentation, medical computing, mobile computing, neural nets, personal computing, prediction theory, Im2Calories, automated mobile vision food diary, content recognition, nutritional content prediction, restaurant, multilabel classifier, food prediction, nutritional facts, CNN-based classifier, food size estimation, depth estimation, volume estimation, Image segmentation, Mobile communication, Visualization, Image recognition, Cameras, Machine learning},\n\tpages = {1233--1241}\n}",
