# Models
We followed an end-to-end approach to solve the calorie prediction  problem of food images. To do so we used a pretrained ResNet and DenseNet architecture. We kept the feature extractor layers and replaced the last fully-connected classification layer. We try to solve the problem interpreting it on the one hand as a classification task and on the other hand as a regression problem. Furthermore we introduced additional learning feedback following a mutli-task approach.

We describe in the following only the last layer of the neural network.  

In the regression case we trained a model predicting only the kcal information with one output neuron and another to predict additionally protein, fat and carbohydrates information using 4 neurons. The two models were trained using a L1 and smooth L1 loss.

We transformed the two already described models to a classification problem quantising the regression outputs. So we introduced 50 class buckets for each regression output. The models were trained using a cross entropy loss.

The multi-task model is based on the regression model including the nutritional information with additional binary outputs to predict the top n ingredientssa
